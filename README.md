# hello-world

Hello there!

I am very new to GitHib and various other things similar to programming.
I am currently studying to become an electrical engineer. Lately, I've
been trying to do my own research into self driving features. I know
a bit about hardware communication, but looking to explore a bit on the
software side of things.
